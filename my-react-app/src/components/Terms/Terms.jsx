          <li>
            <strong>Application:</strong> To apply for a loan, you must provide accurate and complete information,
            including financial information and documentation.
          </li>

            <strong>Quick Approval:</strong> We strive to provide quick loan approvals, but the final decision rests

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Loan Approval:</strong> Loan approval is subject to the creditworthiness assessment and internal
            policies of the respective bank or NBFC.

          <li>
            <strong>Loan Terms:</strong> The terms and conditions of each loan, including interest rates, repayment
            terms, and fees, will be provided to you by the bank or NBFC before you accept the loan.

          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Repaying your loan in a timely manner as per the agreed-upon schedule with the bank or
 NBFC is critical. Failure to make repayments on time may result in penalties, increased
 interest rates, or additional fees as specified in the loan agreement. Defaults can have severe
 consequences, including negative credit reporting, legal action initiated by the lender, and a
 potential loss of future borrowing opportunities. Borrowers are urged to stay informed about
 their repayment schedules, maintain financial discipline, and contact their respective
 financial institution if they foresee challenges in meeting their obligations to explore possible
 solutions.

          <p className="mt-4 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          The interest rates applicable to your loan, as well as any associated fees such as processing
 charges, prepayment penalties, or late payment fees, are determined solely by the financial
 institution providing the loan. LoanOk plays no role in setting or influencing these terms.
 Borrowers should note that interest rates are calculated based on factors such as
 creditworthiness, loan amount, tenure, and type of loan. All applicable charges will be
 disclosed by the lender prior to loan approval, allowing borrowers to make informed
 decisions. It is advisable to review these terms carefully and clarify any doubts directly with
 the financial institution before proceeding.

          <p className="mt-4 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          LoanOk serves as a digital bridge connecting borrowers with trusted banks and NBFCs,
 streamlining the process of finding and applying for loans. While we facilitate
 communication and assist borrowers in navigating the loan application process, we do not
 directly offer loans or influence approval decisions. Additionally, LoanOk has a network of
 agents who provide support and guidance to borrowers throughout the application process.
 These agents can assist with understanding loan requirements, documentation needs, and
 timelines. However, it is important to note that agents cannot guarantee specific timelines for
 loan approval or disbursal, as these depend on the policies and processes of the financial
 institutions involved.

          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          As part of the loan application process, banks and NBFCs conduct rigorous background
 checks to assess eligibility. These checks typically include an evaluation of your credit
 history, employment details, income stability, and any existing financial obligations.
 Satisfactory verification is essential for loan approval, and any discrepancies or adverse
 findings, such as a low credit score or negative legal records, may result in the rejection of
 your application. LoanOk facilitates the sharing of your application details with financial
 institutions but does not intervene in the verification process or the final decision.
